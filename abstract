#ABSTRACT :
A CANSAT mission is a real simulation of the satellite where all the
hardware and software subsystems of satellite are fitted into a small coke tin size
and means to the phenomenon of learning a satellite . Hence Aathreya is one of
the cansats participating in the competition held by world cansat/rocketry
championship in Serbia . Cansat makes every student to learn about all the
subsystems of the satellite and gives a brief overview of the satellites in space .
The can must possess less weight and has to overcome the tensile strength . It
must have 115mm height and consist of 66mm diameter which can overhold the
weigth upto 150grms and has to obey the objectives under the limitations . These
objectives leads to innovation to overcome the limitations and can be
implemented . Eventually it is pointed that the cansat competition overall aim is
to give the higher school studies to plan and design the cansat and conduct there
own space mission in a smaller scale .
