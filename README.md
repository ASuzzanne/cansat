#CANSAT
We are the team AATHREYA from Anurag University ,
Hyderabad , Telangana , INDIA . Our motto is to build a CANSAT with the
objectives given by WCRC SERBIA . We are a batch of 5 members who are
specialized in various departments .
Sakshi venepally : Works on parachute design .
Vinushna lakkakula : Works on building Can .
Aamena Suzzanne : Works on Ground station .
Saripalli Shelsi : Works on Ground station .
Ramya Jakka : Works on payload , EPS , Communication .
The team Aathreya have started working on this project since one month in our
college . We have undergone many testings on various aspects and came up with
many innovative ideas . Our outreach for this project has gone through many
decisions and considerations of our team . On 25-09-2022 Aathreya was launched
by a rocket to an altitude of approximately 500m. During the descent the CANSAT
measures the required parameters and gives the data . This phenomenon was
carried away by the team Aathreya with many no.of trails. The team was
succeded in implementing the launch precisely .

#INTRODUCTION
 The main objective of the cansat is that using all the required
subsystems , the limitations made by wcrc must be satisfied . Therefore the
primary mission of the Aathreyaâ€™s cansat is that , as the cansat when inserted in
the sounding rocket and launched and deployed after reaching an altitude of
500m , the cansat descents and needs to measure the air pollution . Where as the
secondary mission is that when we send an uplink command to the can while
descenting it must be able to deploy unwanted antennas or the national flag etc.
these were the two main objectives of the cansat .
First of all looking into the primary mission while the can is being descented the
sensors integrated on the pcb calculate the data of air pollution which calculates
the air quality index and also some other parameters such as humidity and
temperature etc. And coming into the secondary mission the pcb is mounted with
the servo meter to implement it for deploying unwanted cloth piece etc. While
descenting down the can must be able to read the real time data and analyse the
data for every two seconds and transmit to the ground station .
